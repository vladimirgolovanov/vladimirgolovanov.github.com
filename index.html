        <!--<p>Hello, dear princess Celestia!</p>-->
        <p>I am Vladimir. Male, born in 80s in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Live with my wife in a small suburb near Moscow with two cats.</p>
        <p>I work as a web developer, but in personal life I prefer non digital things, like <a href="/photos/">film photos</a>, handmade glassware.</p>
        <p>I think brass is the new gold. I like new and old things made from brass.</p>
        <p>I am trying to grow basilic, arugula, spearmint and roses on a kitchen window.</p>
        <p>I like small shops and local brands (especially with tens of years of history).</p>
        <p>Spent about a year dancing jazz and blues.</p>
        <p>I like everything, but the plot in movies.</p>
        <p>Something about the music:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>vacinnes - what did you expect from vaccines</li>
            <li>vampire weekend</li>
            <li>angels and airwaves - i-empire</li>
            <li>mina - se telefonando</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I prefer ultra lightweight travelling with only kanken as a backpack.</p>
